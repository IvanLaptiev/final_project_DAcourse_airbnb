# final_project_DAcourse_airbnb
For the Final Project of the Data Analytics Course that I took in the Hebrew University, we've been tasked to clean a large Airbnb dataset, to find a research question, to analyze the remaining data, and to summarize the results accordingly. While conducting the analysis, I have mostly used Excel, Python, Tableau... and certainly a LOT of ChatGPT:)
